- How the environment shapes culture and conflict

**2. HISTORY & MYTHOLOGY**
- Founding myth / creation story

- Factions, empires, or civilisations that rose and fell

**3. PEOPLES & CULTURES**
- 2-3 distinct groups with unique values, aesthetics, and tensions
- What they each want and fear

**4. POWER SYSTEMS**
- Magic, technology, or social hierarchy that drives plot
- Its rules, costs, and limits (a power with no cost is boring)

- The central tension the story will explore
- Three factions with competing legitimate claims
